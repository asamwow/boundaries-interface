#+title: Boundaries - Models and Interfaces
#+author: Samuel Jahnke

This library houses shared code that is run on both on the server and on any
client for http://boundaries.cloud simulation game.

The benefits of open source are obvious but specifically we want to give people
the opportunity to produce and customize their own clients. If you love
something, set it free, and we just want as much interest into the game as
possible. By giving away control of the clients, the backend developers will
have more time to improve performance, write test code, and provide support to
developers.

The goal of the game is to be a combination of dwarf fortress and roblox. To
truly define what the metaverse is. To be the backbone of internet real-estate.
